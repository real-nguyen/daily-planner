# Daily Planner

This web application implemented with the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack is inspired by a daily time management system that I used in a paper notebook. The system focused on long-term goals (e.g. finishing a personal project, reaching a goal weight), priority tasks (e.g. work tasks, working out), recurrent tasks (e.g. language studies, playing guitar), and free time (everything else). *When* the tasks were done does not matter as long as they are done. Basically, a glorified to-do list.

Daily Planner is unfinished, and I do not plan to finish nor deploy it. This was more of a learning experience to see how well I understood the concepts and usage of the MEAN stack. At a certain point, I felt like I spent too much time on it, and going further with the other details I wanted to implement wouldn't contribute much to what I wanted to get out of this project.

## Requirements

To run Daily Planner, you need a local installation of MongoDB, the latest Angular CLI version, and Node.js.

## Running the app

To run the REST API, open a terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and run the command `npm run start:server`. The API listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

To run the Angular client, open a separate terminal, navigate to the root of the project, and run the command `ng serve`. To view the web app, either navigate to `http://localhost:4200` or add the `--open` flag to the `ng serve` command.
